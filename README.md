**E-MAIL ADDRESS VALIDATOR**
```
E-mail address valition, using Regex and Python.

Had to do within three hours, so i was really kick by doing all the strings treatments with splits, replaces and conditionals to throw all the cleaned output to a .JSON file and save it. 

- First step that i did was separate the username from the domain, so it was possible to have the domain result already.
- The second one was treat the username, removing dots and comments.
- The third part was just pick the timestamp when the application was still running.
- The last part is all about validating the domain and the username, and after return true or false for which one of them.
